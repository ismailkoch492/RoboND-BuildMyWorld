# RoboND-BuildMyWorld

![custom_world](media/gazebo_world.jpg)


In this project, a custom world was designed and tested in Gazebo. The custom world consists of a group of colored walls named basic_office, some default Gazebo models, and a custom model, a four-wheeled robot named fw_robot. The world file is written in XML format but generated via Gazebo. The world file utilizes welcome_message as a plugin. This plugin file is the compiled welcome_message.cpp. Here is a portion of the world file defining the welcome_message plugin:
```xml
  <world name='default'>
    <plugin name='welcome_message' filename='libwelcome_message.so'/>
```
